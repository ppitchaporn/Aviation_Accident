Mini Project: A 55-Year Overview of Aviation Accidents (1970-2025)  
[DADS5001: Data Analytics and Data Science Tools and Programming]
=======
## Introduction
Aviation has long been one of the most significant modes of transportation in modern society, offering speed, efficiency, and global connectivity. However, despite continuous advancements in technology and safety protocols, aviation accidents still occur. 

This study examines the trends and patterns of aviation accidents over the past 55 years, with a particular focus on the United States and a comparative analysis of commercial aviation accidents. The structure of the analysis is outlined as follows.

Part 1 – Overview of Global Aviation Accidents

Part 2 - U.S. Aviation Accident Insights

Part 3 - Comparative Study of Commercial Aviation Accident Trends

## Data Source
https://www.ntsb.gov/Pages/home.aspx Data for this analysis was obtained from the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), an independent U.S. government agency responsible for investigating civil transportation accidents.

## Research Questions
1. Is the frequency of aviation accidents increasing or decreasing over time?
2. Human error remains the leading cause of aviation accidents?
3. Has the safety of commercial air travel improved based on fatal accident rates over time?

## • Part 1 - Overview of Global Aviation Accidents in 1970-2025
A high-level view of accident trends and severity levels.

***Figure 1: Trends in Aviation Accidents (1970-2025)***  
xxx  
•2001 – 9/11 attacks (likely followed by tighter aviation regulations)  
•2020 – COVID-19 pandemic (massive drop in flights and thus accidents)
